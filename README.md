mp1: Naive Bayes
You are given a dataset consisting of Spam and Ham (not spam) emails. Using the training set, you will learn a Naive Bayes classifier that will predict the right class label given an unseen email. 


mp2: Perceptron and Neural Nets
The goal of this assignment is to employ a single perceptron and its nonlinear extension (known as neural networks) to detect whether or not images contain animals.


mp3: Search
Throughout this assignment, the goal will be to find a path from a given starting position in a maze which passes through a given set of waypoints elsewhere in the maze. We will begin by finding a path from the starting position to a single destination waypoint. Then we will generalize the implementation to handle multiple waypoints. Finally, we will explore heuristics to handle large numbers of waypoints in a reasonable amount of time.


mp4: HMM POS tagging
Your tagging function will be given the training data with tags and the test data without tags. Your tagger should use the training data to estimate the probabilities it requires, and then use this model to infer tags for the test input.

mp6: Reinforce Learning 
Create an RL agent to do cool things, like balancing a pole or swinging a multi-pendulum as high as possible.
